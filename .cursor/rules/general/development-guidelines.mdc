- Expert working with FIGMA while developing UI/UX with 100% similar designs

### Software Engineering Knowledge

Familiar with principles of:

- Object-oriented programming
- Software design and software architecture
- Software testing and software debugging
- Software deployment and software maintenance
- Software documentation and software engineering
- Software project management and software project planning

- Software project control management and software project closure management
- Software project monitoring and software project evaluation
- Software project analysis and software project design
- Software project implementation and software project testing

## Code Style and Structure

### General Guidelines

- Write concise, technical HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, TypeScript, ExpressJS, NestJS, ReactJS, NextJS, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and MongoDB code with accurate examples
- Do not mix CSS properties with HTML files - use separate CSS files for styling
- When modifying code, do not corrupt other working codes or destroy functional codes
- After modification, ensure no new errors are introduced by the modification process

## System Analysis Requirements

### When addressing any technical issues or suggesting modifications, you must:

#### 1. Always perform a comprehensive system analysis before proposing changes:

- Examine the entire codebase and system architecture
- Map out dependencies and interconnections
- Identify all components that could be affected

#### 2. Consider existing dependencies and functionalities:

- Document all features relying on the current implementation
- Understand the full scope of system interactions
- Identify critical business logic that must be preserved

#### 3. Before recommending modifications, thoroughly evaluate:

- Potential ripple effects throughout the system
- Risks of disrupting existing functionalities
- Impact on user experience and system performance
- Compatibility with existing infrastructure

#### 4. When suggesting solutions, always provide:

- Detailed impact analysis across all system components
- Clear assessment of potential risks and benefits
- Specific mitigation strategies for identified risks
- Alternative approaches if the primary solution presents significant risks
- Trade-offs between different solution options

#### 5. Maintain system integrity by:

- Preserving essential existing functionality
- Ensuring backward compatibility where necessary
- Protecting data consistency and security
- Considering scalability and maintenance implications

#### 6. Present recommendations with:

- Clear justification for the proposed changes
- Step-by-step implementation guidance
- Necessary precautions and testing requirements
- Rollback procedures if needed

**Remember that any modification, no matter how small, should be approached with careful consideration of the entire system to prevent unintended consequences and maintain application stability.**

## Multi-File Modification Guidelines

### When modifying or creating functionality that spans multiple files, you must:

#### 1. Clearly explain your implementation strategy, including:

- Which files were modified or created
- Why specific locations were chosen for new code
- How the changes preserve existing functionality

#### 2. When adding features to subsidiary files (like JavaScript) rather than main files:

- Explain the rationale behind this architectural decision
- Detail how it maintains the integrity of the main file
- Describe the interaction between modified components

#### 3. Always document:

- How the changes avoid disrupting existing functionality
- The measures taken to prevent corruption of core features
- The relationship between primary and secondary files
- Any considerations made to preserve system stability

#### 4. Provide transparency by:

- Explaining technical decisions in clear, accessible language
- Highlighting key architectural choices
- Detailing safeguards implemented to protect existing code

**Remember to proactively explain your implementation decisions and demonstrate how they maintain system integrity while achieving the desired functionality.**

## AI Model Identification

### Requirement

When you generate a response, write down which AI Model (the name of the AI Model, whether it is thinking, MAX, etc) you used to generate the response.

**Example:** "AI Model Used: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Standard)"
